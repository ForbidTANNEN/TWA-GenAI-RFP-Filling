There are no other operating system or hardware requirements. \ Technological Requirements |What DB engine is used for LIMS system? |The infrastructure is Salesforce data centers, which are comprised of either AWS managed hardware or Oracle servers. \ System Scalability / System Configuration |Is the system configurable to specific lab needs? If so, how are different workflows defined |Yes, Lockbox is fully configurable. Customers can create any number of workflows and protocols. \ System Scalability / System Configuration |How easy can the system be modified to meet future needs? (Once system is up and running - how difficult is it to modify workflow, add new capabilities, new data types or fields) |It is very easy to modify the system after it is up and running. No technical software coding experience is required. Any lab staff member can make updates after they receive some initial training. \ System Scalability / System Configuration |Is there a maximum number of users allowed? (Simultaneous / Licensed) |No maximum \ System Scalability / System Configuration |What is the configurability with the LIMS DB with internal DB Tables created by Vendor to support their own features along with the need of specific data relationships which must exists for our own data commercialization at the end of assay development?|Lockbox is highly configurable: customers can create their own custom DB tables for whatever custom requirements they have. Those tables can then be related to existing vendor-created tables seamlessly.\ Security and Compliance Requirements |Support 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance |Yes, supports 21 CFR Part 11 \ Security and Compliance Requirements |Can users be limited to certain features and data of LIMS system based on roles. Further defined by read only, read/write, or full? |Yes to all \ Security and Compliance Requirements |Can updates completed be reversed without impact entire system (via a restore). If allowed, what is factor determine when it no longer can be done. |Updates can be manually reversed by looking at the audit trail, which retains the history of all data changes: who made the change, the old value and the new value. \ Security and Compliance Requirements |Does LIMS provide Audit Trail capabilities? |Yes \ Security and Compliance Requirements |Is the database encrypted (at rest / in transit)? |Yes with the purchase of the encryption add-on module \ Service and Support |What type of installation and ongoing support is provided? |Full installation consulting services are provided when purchased via a Statement of Work (SOW). On-going support is provided as well for mainentance of existing features if questions or issues arise. \ Interfacing with Data Types / Files |What type of import/export methods are supported? |CSV files can be imported/exported. Data can also be imported/exported via APIs through integration \ Interfacing with Data Types / Files |Can LIMS be configured to map data entries in files to data elements in DB |Yes \ Interfacing with Data Types / Files |Does LIMS system support exporting data to local drive or AWS (UI & programmatically)? |Yes \ Interfacing with Data Types / Files |Can files be attached to data elements as references (PDF, jpg, docx, etc.). |Yes \ Interfacing with Data Types / Files |What kind of external APIs are supported? |Please see this list for all APIs supported: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/apis \ Interfacing with Data Types / Files |if Cloud solution is used, which cloud is the LIMS database stored? |Salesforce.com \ LIMS Software Updates |Does LIMS provider provide support for future updates to LIMS system? |Yes \ LIMS Software Updates |How are updates to LIMS software system validated with our own data/environment? |We perform internal vendor verification and provide the test scripts to customers so that customers can perform their own software validation. \ Usability & Help |What kind of help is available? (generalized help, online help, customizable help) |We offer a comprehensive customer portal which has a large number of help articles. We also offer cases and email support. Phonse support is available when needed. \ Details regarding Database Engine / Structure for LIMS |Does LIMS allow for custom data structures to support specific data types |Yes \ Administrative : Staff Training & Instrument Maintenance Schedules|Does LIMS track scheduled maintenance activities for instruments |Yes \ System Capabilities for the Lab |Does LIMS keep track of inventory levels of any and all materials used during Lab work? |Yes \ System Capabilities for the Lab |Does LIMS keep track of inventory which has expiration dates |Yes \ System Capabilities for the Lab |Can LIMS provide quality checks between different modules or workflows? |Yes \ System Capabilities for the Lab |Does the system allow for predefined data validation rules which determine if test/entry is complete. |Yes \ System Capabilities for the Lab |Need the ability to document/comment at each stage of the progress as methods are developed (ELN) |Yes. \
