\
Is the documentation of Vendor Verification testing reviewed by QA?
Answer: Yes. Vendor Verification is an OPTIONAL SERVICE provided by TWA. StageBio could decide to provide such services themselves, in which case TWA would refer to such services as Verification (thus dropping "Vendor" as such services would be provided by StageBio). In this case, StageBio made such a request which was documented in Statement of Work "Lockbox LIMS StageBio Statement of Work #1 Amended and Restated FE" signed on OCT/9/2022. In response, TWA executed and delivered documented evidence of a customized verification of StageBio User Stories / Requirements. Specific to this question, all Vendor Verification documents generated by TWA are reviewed by TWA's Software QA Team.

\
Provide documentation related to the security features deployed within the product including: Hardware Controls, MFA, SAML, IAM, Data At\Rest, Data Transmission, Encryption, Super User, etc.
Answer: N/A. StageBio's instance of Salesforce is capable of supporting/enforcing all such security elements, and more, albeit it is ultimately StageBio's responsibility to configure their Salesforce org accordingly, and ensure that such configuration is maintained over time. MFA: MFA will be required by Salesforce in the near-future, and thus won't be able to be turned off. SAML: SAML 2.0 is supported and can be used to enable SSO with Identity Providers which also support SAML 2.0 such as Microsoft, Google, OKTA, Duo, and more. Data Encryption at Rest: Salesforce sells Platform Encryption (one of three features within Salesforce Shield) which enable the encryption of most types of field-level data. Noting, that by default, such encryption is off. Planning, Analysis, configuration, testing, and roll out is recommended. Encryption in Transit: This is always required and is standard SSL/HTTPS/TLS etc. when establishing a connection between an end-user's browser and Lockbox LIMS. User Profiles: Various levels of Privilege can be afforded to different Profiles, with the highest level of privilege reserved for Profile = System Administrator.
\
Do requirements include regulatory requirements?
Answer: No. TWA is not aware of the mapping from StageBio's Regulatory Requirements to those User Stories as documented in supplied Vendor Verification documentation.
\
Are there traceability matrices between specifications and programs? Between specifications and tests?
Answer: Yes. TWA's Vendor Verification services and related documentation provide such information as User Stories > Test Case > Expected Result > Actual Result > Result Classification (Pass/Fail).
\
Is a maintenance/support agreement utilized? If yes, what software product elements are maintained and supported?
Answer: Yes. Break/Fix support (Support Plan North America (Standard) is included with the cost of the Lockbox LIMS subscription, and has the following limitations: "Support plans listed above do not include (a) training of Customer's personnel; (b) resolving problems that result from Customer's use of the Service that is not in conformance with the Documentation; (c) resolving problems caused by changes, alterations or revisions made by Customer or on Customer's behalf (other than by Third Wave); (d) resolving problems caused by third party Service, Customer's data or network, or operational or environmental issues; or (e) any support to develop new features/functions/processes that would normally be considered 'Professional Services' and delivered via a Statement of Work (i.e. configuration services, custom software development, or any other consulting activities to support new functionality)."
\
Provide a copy of the EOS and EOL (End of Support, End of Life) policies related to the products being offered.

\
Are random audits executed against the different areas of the platform to ensure compliance (e.g. SDLC, User Access, Data Access, Administrative Access, etc.) and are these audits compared against historical audits to identify irregularities or patterns of potential misuse and detailed enough to identify specific user/date/time? Provide a copy of the latest security audit that has been completed.
Answer: Yes. Audits, both internal and external, are regularly performed against the Salesforce Platform. We've included numerous PDFs from https://compliance.salesforce.com/en/documents as part of our response.
