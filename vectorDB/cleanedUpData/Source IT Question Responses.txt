You mentioned that customers back up their LIMS data with CSV exports are there any other best practice methods for backing up these tables and config?
Are there any preferred tools for this?  Most of our customers either use Salesforce's built in CSV extract tool to run weekly periodic backups to CSV or use third-party tools such as OwnBackup to backup data.  Regarding configuration, you have available 25 configuration only sandboxes and 1 configuration and partial copy data sandbox.  Often we'll used one of these configuration only sandboxes to take backups at key times when there's a significant change since the configuration can be easily re-migrated.  A more robust solution can involve using GitHub or OwnBackup for this as well.\
How are these backups restored in the event of a LIMS failure or misconfiguration?  CSV exports would require a much more manual data restoration process of determining what data is missing/changed and reloading from the files.  OwnBackup has more extensive data comparison tools for doing this work (see the link above).  Regarding configuration, this can be migrated from a sandbox to PRD fairly easily, again, depending on the volume of changes. GitHub can also be used for configuration backup.

Who is responsible for data loss and downtime in the event of the LIMS service failing? Lockbox runs on the Salesforce platform and thus Salesforce handles the underlying data storage, data availability, and data redundancy.  These articles provide some details regarding their architectural principles for high availability.  Downtimes tend to be few, far between, and short.  However, we would certainly recommend having contingency plans in place in case of a downtime.

How are files uploaded to the LIMS such as PDFs backed up?  These can be backed up using the methodologies mentioned.
Are most customers pairing Lockbox with AWS for storage of files etc? This depends on the file sizes.  Salesforce and Lockbox aren’t designed for hosting lots of large files (100s of MB).  In this case clients pair with some other data storage, such as AWS.  However, for smaller (multi-megabyte) files, they will often store these directly in Lockbox.

Which changes to the configuration are able to be reverted in the UI and which admin controlled configurations are more persistent? Which admin side config changes should be avoided or could be dangerous? Is there a guide for this?  Most changes can be reverted fairly easily.  Additionally, there’s a Setup Audit Trail that tracks what changes were made by whom and when.  The primary “dangerous” exception would be any form of automation since any records that have been subjected to the automation will have been changed, and thus those records will need to be cleaned up as well as the automation needing to be reverted.  This is why we recommend making any significant changes in a sandbox where they can be thoroughly tested prior to migration to PRD.

re there acceptable use figures for egress and ingress of data? i.e. if we are backing up huge amounts of data can we hit a limit of data transferred per day?
Since Salesforce is multi-tenant there are acceptable use figures. However, for the scenario mentioned, you’d likely use the Bulk API which has very high limits.  This reference has more details.  Note that this limit can be increased.
\
Is there a limit for data storage per instance? i.e. a max database size of 1TB or something?
Yes, it depends on the number of users and can be increased. Be default it is basically 10 GB of data storage, plus 10GB of file storage, plus 2GB of file storage per user.  Note that these limits can be increased
\
Is there a Lockbox service level agreement for uptime and response time to major incidents?  We have two different support plans.  Our standard (complimentary) support has first response time of 8 hours for general guidance and 4 hours for business critical issues.  This is provided Mon-Fri (excluding holidays) 8-15 GMT/BST.  Our enhanced support is $1900 per month and enhanced the response time to 2 hours (general) and 1 hour (business critical). In this case, support is provided Mon-Fri 7-24 GMT/BST.

Are all the Salesforce contracts managed through ThirdWave or does Source take on any of the accounting or responsibilities for interacting with Salesforce?  You don’t need to work directly with Salesforce, all contracting is done with Third Wave.  You’ll see as part of our MSA we include an appendix that states the passthrough terms of our relationship with Salesforce.

We would like to find a way to archive email conversations along with the project information. Is there any way to integrate MS Exchange based emails into Lockbox and associating them with the project entities? It might be that this task is best accomplished in some other tool. You can use Einstein Activity Capture to capture and integrate MS Exchange or Office365 emails to Contact records in Lockbox.  In the demo, we didn’t show this, but Projects can be linked to Accounts and Contacts can be linked to Accounts as well.  In this way, you could easily look at the relevant Contact records and see all associated emails.
