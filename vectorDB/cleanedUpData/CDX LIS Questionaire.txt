Accessioning / Order Management |During the accessioning process, can users add physicians and/or insurance companies not yet in the system? What configuration options are available? |Yes, can do. \ | | \ |Can CDx separate the accessioning from patient and billing data entry? |Yes, can do. \ | | \ Patient Demographics |What attributes are available regarding patient demographics? |As many as are needed. In practice, there is no limit to the number of user defined fields which can be tracked. \ |Does the system manage for unique patient ID including records from vendor EMR interfaces? |All records in the system have a unique system ID. In addition, records typically have an external ID and an internal ID which is configurable if a specific mask is required. \ |Are separate attributes available for billing related functions, alternate name, billing address, etc.. |Yes, such fields are available. \ |What ability exist to create custom fields? |Custom Fields can be created rapidly using click-driven configuration. For more information, browse to the following URL:<br>https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.adding_fields.htm&type=5<br> \ Patient Billing data entry |How are insurance companies/polices managed? What billing data fields are available during the accessioning process. |Like many things in Lockbox LIMS, there is more than one way to manage Insurance Companies. We would make a recommendation (for example, Insurance Companies can be represented as Accounts with Type=Payee) upon understanding your requirements.<br><br>Re: Polices, such insurance policy information can be captured on the Patient record, for example. \ |Re: billing data fields, as above, since there is no practical limit to the number of user defined fields, such data fields can be created as required. \ | \ Result Report Delivery |What methods are available? Analog Fax, eFax, email? |Outbound communication is enabled with system generated email, along with by-directional eFax with QR coding for record level association of PDFs. \ Is it possible for clients to receive reports using more that one method? |Yes, Clients can receive reports via eFax, or alternatively via a Lockbox LIMS Customer Portal (powered by Salesforce Digital Experiences). \ Are users able to re-send results? |Yes, internal Lockbox LIMS users are able to resend a report, for example via eFax. \ What function or process is available to deliver result reports directly to patients? |Patients can engage with Cleveland Dx via a Lockbox LIMS Patient Portal (powered by Salesforce Digital Experiences) \ Provider and Customer Demographics |What are the set up options for CDx accounts? i.e. is the ability to have parent or umbrella accounts? If so, can we limit Customer access a the child or location level? What data fields are available, email, phone, etc.. |Account parent / child relationships are supported.<br><br>Re: controlling Customer access at the Child level, yes, assuming that the Customer User is associated with the Child. \ |Re: data fields available, there are a number of default fields together with as many additional user defined fields as required \ | \ Customer Support Module<br>(For use between CDx Staff and departments) |Can CDx lab users open "ticket" or assign issues to other CDx users / departments? What functions exits for colleting CDx client reported issues? Electronically capture paper requestions, billing documentation, and any related documenting to patient orders. |If CDx Lab Users are appropriately licensed (Salesforce CRM), they can create and interact with a Case directly which would fulfill the ticketing use case described. If not appropriately licensed, case creation would need to be indirectly triggered by the lab users actions which would require customization. \ |Re: CDx Client Issues, as above, the Salesforce Service Cloud provides extensive Case Management features and functions. \ |Re: Electronically capturing paper forms, yes, such forms can be converted to PDF (for example) and then saved as a File on the appropriate record. \ Reports & Analytics |Commercial and aggregation reports and analytic capabilities. Laboratory operation reports. TAT, quality, etc.. |Operational, Management, and ad-hoc reporting is made possible by using the Salesforce Lightning Reporting tool to analyze any/all data that a user has access to, including CDx lab data along with any other data that the user may be licensed to see (CRM, for example). \ | \ | \ QC Module | |Yes, Lockbox LIMS can record quality events. \ Does the system have a QC Module that eliminates Paper QC? | \ | \ Vendor Reliability / Capabilities |How long as the vendor been in business? How log have the offered SaaS delivery module? Is the hosed solution different from their previous product offering? Etc.. See comments ===> |Third Wave Analytics (TWA) has been in business for 7 years, with Lockbox LIMS being commercially available for the last 6. \ Lockbox LIMS is the first and only SaaS application developed by TWA, which means all of our resources are committed to it. \ \ Availability |Need system uptime performance rate and operational procedures if internet connection is lost or application is unavailable. Request vendor's DR strategy including Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO). See comments ===> |Re: RTO/RPO, we recommend partnering with OwnBackup to configure recovery capabilities as required. For more information, see the following URL:<br><br>https://www.ownbackup.com/blog/define-salesforce-rto-rpo/ \ \ \ Scalability |Two areas of scalability :<br>1- who manages the hosting site system resources? Obtain data usage policies and rates for the hosting site.<br>2- How does the application scale? Is there a way to measure performance against volume and number of users, etc., |Lockbox LIMS is not a hosted application. Instead, it is software-as-a-service available on the Salesforce multi-tenant platform. \ Re: Scale, there is no practical limit to the ability to scale on the Salesforce Platform. Of course, requirements and design matter, as such scale does require specific architecture and design patterns which might not be present at significantly lower scale.\ \ Data |What is the data retention policy? How long are patient records kept and how can CDx access historical files? |Data on the platform is retained forever, and is not deleted by the system. Logs of the changes to such data, over time, are kept for 10 years. \ \ \ Architecture Design |Obtain application architecture, Single-tenant or Multi-tenant Architecture - Are we on our own instance of the software? Are we on our own server or share? |Salesforce Multi-tenant, for more information see the following URL:<br><br>https://architect.salesforce.com/fundamentals/platform-multitenant-architecture<br> \ \ \ Hosting Service Provider |Hosting Service Provider or Data Center (AWS, Azure, etc.) Where is the PHI Data Stored Geographically? |Primary and Secondary Data Center Locations can be found by looking up CDx's Instance ID on the following table:<br><br>https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000382217&type=1 \ \ \ Security |Need to understand connection security protocols, tenant–level security, usage restrictions, data restrictions, encryptions, user– and role–level privileges. Need to prevent web access from unsecured networks or non-company-managed devices (SSO and allowing access only from specified IP addresses.)|There are quite a few questions here, each of which might trigger a significant amount of information to form an appropriate response. With that said, here is a summary:<br><br>Connection Security Protocols: HTTPS with TLS 1.2, for more information see:<br>https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_other_changes.htm&type=5&release=220<br><br>Encryption: Data at-rest can be encrypted using Salesforce's Platform Encryption. For more information, see:<br>https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.security_pe_concepts.htm&type=5<br><br>User Security Model: Lockbox LIMS uses Salesforce's access security model, utilizing profiles, roles, permission sets, permission set groups, and more. For more information see:<br>https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.securityImplGuide.meta/securityImplGuide/security_feature_setup.htm<br><br>SSO: Lockbox LIMS is SAML 2.0 compliant and can use Microsoft Office365, Google, OKTA, and many other identity providers to control user provisioning from hire to retire.<br><br>IP Restrictions: Lockbox LIMS User access can be restricted via whitelisting IP ranges via configuration. For more information see:<br>https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.security_networkaccess.htm&type=5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\ \ \ Monitoring |What is policy/procedure for application usage, database, error and event monitoring. Who monitors what? How does the hosted environment scale, up or back, to accommodate CPU and data usage? |Users with active accounts and valid credentials & MFA can consume the Lockbox LIMS service at any time, location, allowed IP address, etc. without limit.<br><br>Event Monitoring: Multiple system logs track changes to user defined fields, user access, and system configuration. All such logs are unable to be deleted/altered, and are fully reportable using the standard Salesforce Lightning Reporting tool. Monitoring would be CDx's responsibility, which can support detective controls or in some cases, notifications will be sent out when a prevent control was triggered.<br><br>Since Lockbox LIMS is SaaS, and not hosted, there are no specific hosted-system concerns which need to be addressed. \ \ \ Instrument Interfacing |Requirements and methods to connect the Cobas to LIS. Who supports the interface? Is Hardware required and included in quote? |Low-level hardware (RS-232) interfaces ('Host') with clinical-only instruments such as the Roche Cobas line of analyzers is not something Lockbox LIMS itself can support. \ \ \ Integration: |Need to understand the application's ability to integrate with internal and external systems. Need to understand the feasibility and level of effort. |Lockbox LIMS is enabled with numerous APIs, including RESTful, Pub/Sub, SOAP, and more, which use web-standard methods to securely credential (OATH), for example. Such APIs support gets and puts as required. When complex operations are required, it may be required to create custom web-services using the Salesforce codling language called APEX. TWA routinely develops custom web services for Lockbox LIMS customers.<br><br>Authentication can be achieved through various means, while OAuth2.0 / Connected App Configuration together with a dedicated 'headless' user is common. \ \ \ Active Directory Integration |Is AD integration available for CDx accounts? |Yes, via SSO configuration to Office365. If on-prem Microsoft AD is in play, please contact us for more information as this may require movement to Office365. \ \ \ Configuration Capability |Which part of the service is configurable? i.e. UI, Branding, Authentication, Role/Privileges, business rules, business processes, system and/or database integration. |All listed examples are configurable. Note that the Salesforce Platform was purpose built to accommodate configuration at various levels in the application stack, with meta data layers from a specific end-user, through the application, instance, tenant, and core. \ \ \ Upgrade & Support |Product update policy and customer support SLA? What is the process for support calls? i.e. Single contact for all issues or separate contacts for application and hosting issues? |Lockbox LIMS updates are made available to Customers at no cost. Support SLAs are available at standard and enhanced levels. Support is provided typically by the same resources who were involved in the original implementation. \ \ \ Existing System / Data |What data can be migrated from CDx existing system? If so, how is this done - file upload, DB import etc.? Would this include discrete data, customer and patient demographics, result reports? |There are several ways to ingest external data (source) to Lockbox LIMS (destination). Among them are file-based uploads which can be rapidly configured using declarative methods. There is no technical limit on the types of data which can be uploaded using the above method.<br><br>Pending review of the scope and requirements of the migration, alternative methods can be explored. \ \ \ User Permissions |Can CDx manage user access? Role based permission capabilities? How are Customer accounts managed? Who is responsible for supporting CDx Customer's access management and support? |Yes, CDx System Administrators can manage user access. In addition, System Admins have access to configure roles, permission sets, etc.<br><br>CDx Customer Account management is specific to CDx business processes.<br><br>CDx Customers who have issues accessing a Provider Portal (for example), can request a password rest from Lockbox using the standard "Forgot My Password" link which will guide the end user through a password reset. Functional support of external CDx Customers does fall on CDx, unless other business obligations have been negotiated between TWA and CDx in advance. \ \ \ Browser and bandwidth requirements |Identify browser requirements, versions and product requirements. i.e. Chrome, Edge, Firefox, ext. And minimum versions of each if applicable) |Current Browser Requirements are listed here:<br>https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.getstart_browsers_sfx.htm&type=5<br><br>Generally, the latest supported versions of MSFT Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox, and Apple's Safari are blessed by Salesforce.<br><br><br> \ \ \ Commercial and Operation Data Availability |How much of the activity data and customer profile data is available by auto download. Are result reports available via an export process? |Apologies, I am unclear on what 'auto download' is.<br><br>Reports can be subscribed to (which will send the current report output to the subscriber consistent with the subscription frequency) and also can be downloaded into XLS and CSV, and can have their format preserved, or can be flattened.<br><br>Subscribing:<br>https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleViewid=sf.reports_subscribe_overview.htm&type=5<br><br>Download/Export:<br>https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.reports_export.htm&type=5<br><br> \ \ \ Result Report |What are the capabilities are available to customize the result report? How are different versions/changes managed? i.e. - if a historical result report is required, is it created in the original version? |Shifting from Salesforce data reporting (HTTPS/XLS/CSV), to Clinical Reporting (PDF), we utilize a platform APEX widget to render PDFs once all of the appropriate logic has been met (CLS Review and Release, for example). Version management is typically tailored to each customers requirements.<br> \ \ \ Test /Panel Build Process |How are testes and panels created in the system? What attributes are available? How are changes managed? |Assuming this is asking how new service lines can be rolled out in Lockbox LIMS, this would depend on many factors:<br><br>Similarity with existing services lines, sample preparation & qc, protocols & procedures, required materials, instrument integrations, changes to compliance requirements, and more.<br><br>Generally, rolling out a new service line (diagnostic test) requires professional services from TWA. More services are required for customers who have taken a hands-off approach to their LIMS, while far fewer services are required for customers who have Salesforce expertise and interest on-staff.<br> \ \ \ Exit |Determine CDx exit strategy. Obtain the process for extracting system data? What are contract termination terms / fees etc.. If vendor is no longer able to provide service, what options are available to retain use of the software? |System data can be extracted through various means, the simplest among them a scheduled file-based export. A host of the other way to extract data exist including the use of AppExchange apps which can establish connections with external databases, API powered queries, OwnBackup, and more.<br><br>Subscription Fees are payable up front, on an annual basis, and non-refundable.<br><br>Should TWA cease to exist as an operating entity, various methods can be negotiated. For example, there may be a scenario where TWA would provide Lockbox LIMS as an unmanaged package to CDx for CDx's use. \ \ \ Hardware devices |What scanners and printers are compatible? Is that part of the service or does CDx need to provide? |CDx is responsible for providing scanners and label printers. In most cases, use of Seagull Scientific's Bartender can enable the use of such hardware. \ \ \ Auditing: |Acquire application's audit logs exist to monitor and record patient record access |Changes to the value of data which happens over time (history), are recorded as a system log entry which cannot be deleted or modified, and are retained for up to 10 years when licensed with Shield.<br><br>In addition, point in time audits can be performed to determine which users have access to sensitive data (assuming such data has been identified as being sensitive).<br><br>Out of the box, there are no specific system logs which memorialize what records an end user accesses.<br><br>Using event monitoring, CDx can configure pre-defined logic in-advance to enact prevent controls. \ including changes (add/modify/remove) directly to the database. Retention of audit logs for at least 7 years. | \ | \ Contract Terms |Need to fully understand the contract terms for the SaaS and Hosting component. |I've provided boilerplate copies of our Master Subscription Agreement along with the response to this questionnaire. \ \ \ Compliance |Understand division of responsible for complying with industry regulations like HIPAA - who is responsible for what. |CDx, as the Covered Entity, is responsible for complying with HIPAA regulations, including determining what level of technical safeguards in Lockbox LIMS are sufficient given the level of risk (again, as determined by CDx).<br><br>TWA, as a Business Associate, is responsible for a) protecting any data in its possession with adequate technical, physical, and administrative safeguards and b) providing for-fee professional services when approved by CDx to configure CDx's instance of Lockbox LIMS to meet CDx's requirements.<br><br>Salesforce, as a Business Associate, is responsible for ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the Lockbox LIMS service and CDx's data and metadata.<br> \ \
