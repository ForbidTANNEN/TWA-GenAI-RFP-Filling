\Users with proper security can create lab orders and data can be checked using validation rules. Each field can provide end-user assistance. Users with both Salesforce CRM and Lockbox licenses can manually link lab orders with opportunities. However, there may options where we could configure automation such that the opportunity could be automatically selected.
\Lockbox LIMS is installed inside Salesforce CRM, making the status sync easy to achieve. Statuses can be updated manually or automatically.
\All changes (up to 100 fields per object) are audited by date, time, user, and old/new values (for most data types). All data update/deletion is controlled by role/profile based security.
